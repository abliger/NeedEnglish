It was a dusty and loose curtain blowing in the wind as a teenager packed up their overcoat and suitcase. They were outside at dusk, and the thunder and lightning overhead made it difficult for them to concentrate on what they had to do.

The teenager was tired of ignoring their partner's concerns, as they disliked joining in on activities and did not get along well with others. They had done this on purpose, but it all added up to a series of arguments and upset situations.

In order to calm themselves down and settle their differences face to face, the two decided to swap places and try to see things from the other's perspective. It was exactly what they needed to recover from their disagreement and be grateful for each other's company.

Despite entirely disagreeing with each other in the past, they now had the power to work through their differences and build a stronger relationship. As they set down the tip they had left for their server on the highway, they fell in love with the idea of being able to get through anything together.

当一个少年收拾好他们的大衣和行李箱时，风中吹来了尘土飞扬的松散窗帘。他们在外面的黄昏，头顶上的雷电使他们难以集中精力做他们必须做的事。

这名少年已经厌倦了无视他们伙伴的担忧，因为他们不喜欢参加活动，也不善于与他人相处。他们是故意这样做的，但这一切都导致了一系列的争吵和不安。

为了让自己冷静下来，面对面地解决他们的分歧，两人决定交换位置，试着从对方的角度看问题。这正是他们需要从分歧中恢复过来并感谢对方的陪伴。

尽管过去完全不同意对方，但他们现在有能力解决他们的分歧，建立更强大的关系。当他们在公路上放下留给服务员的小费时，他们爱上了能够一起度过任何难关的想法。
