Ever since graduating from college, Sarah had been determined to organize a solo cycling trip to visit various temples across the country. Despite her family and friends expressing concern about the disadvantages and potential dangers of traveling alone, Sarah remained stubborn in her attitude and refused to let any shortcomings or setbacks get in her way.

She made up her mind to persuade everyone that she was capable of the journey and could take care of herself. Finally, after much discussion and deliberation, her family gave in as usual, knowing that Sarah would do what she preferred regardless of their schedule or reliable forecast for the journey.

With insurance and a well-planned schedule, Sarah set out on her adventure, journal in hand to record her experiences and view of the world around her. She packed a pillow, a parcel of wool for warmth, and everything else she needed to survive beneath the altitude and pace of her journey.

As she cycled through the flow of the valley, Sarah marveled at the beauty of the bend in the road and the caves hidden in the mountains. She stopped to boil water for tea at midnight, enjoying the peace and quiet of her surroundings.

Despite caring about her loved ones' concerns, Sarah refused to let fear hold her back. She knew that her determined attitude and willingness to persevere would lead her to incredible experiences and views that she would never forget.
