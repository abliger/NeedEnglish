	At dusk, a teenager was struggling to pack up their suitcase in the dusty and loose outdoors, trying to swap their old life for a new beginning.
	
	
	The thunder and lightning didn't help either, adding to the already upset state of the teenager.
	
	
	They had to get along well with their partner, who was concerned about their well-being.
	
	
	However, the teenager was tired of joining in on everything and disliked going through a series of events they entirely disagreed with.
	
	
	Ignoring their partner on purpose, the teenager added up their reasons for leaving and realized it was time to face their fears and settle things once and for all.
	
	
	In order to calm themselves down, they put on their overcoat and opened the dusty curtain to watch the storm.
	
	
	They fell in love with the power of nature and began to recover from their upset state.
	
	
	The partner, grateful that the teenager had finally set down their suitcase, approached them face to face and suggested they start anew.
	
	
	They agreed and decided to tip the scales in their favor by working together to overcome their differences.
	
	
	It wasn't going to be easy, but with their love and determination, they knew they could overcome anything that came their way on this highway of life.
	
	
	
	
	
	黄昏时分，一个少年在尘土飞扬的户外艰难地收拾着他们的行李箱，试图将他们的旧生活换成一个新的开始。雷声和闪电也无济于事，使这个少年本已不安的状态雪上加霜。他们不得不与他们的伙伴相处得很好，他们的伙伴关心他们的福祉。然而，这个少年厌倦了加入一切，不喜欢经历一系列他们完全不同意的事件。
	
	故意忽视他们的伴侣，这名青少年把他们离开的原因加起来，意识到是时候面对他们的恐惧，一劳永逸地解决事情了。为了让自己平静下来，他们穿上大衣，打开尘封的窗帘，观看风暴。他们爱上了大自然的力量，开始从不安的状态中恢复过来。
	
	伙伴对这名少年终于放下了他们的行李箱表示感激，面对面地找到他们，建议他们重新开始。他们同意并决定通过共同努力克服他们的分歧，使天平向他们倾斜。这并不容易，但凭着他们的爱和决心，他们知道他们可以在这条人生的道路上克服任何困难。
