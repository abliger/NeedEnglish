Voyage plays an important part in our lives. At present, people frequently travel to different countries for official or personal reasons, such as Singapore, Malaysia and African countries. Base on the native language of the country, people actually use the language gradually to communicate with the people there. The accent, spelling, expression and usage of vocabulary are all different.

Because of the language barrier, people have to make use of body language to block the communication. However, it is not as effective as fluently commands the language. Come up straight, people may face some difficulties when they travel to a foreign country. For example, when they rent an apartment or take a cab, they need to request for the flat or lift using the native language. Moreover, when they fill up the petrol for their cars, they need to tell the petrol station attendant the type of lorries and their identity. The latter suggest that people should learn the native language before they travel to a foreign country.

航行在我们的生活中起着重要的作用。目前，人们经常因官方或个人原因前往不同的国家，如新加坡、马来西亚和非洲国家。在该国的母语基础上，人们实际上逐渐使用该语言与当地人交流。词汇的重音、拼写、表达和用法都不一样。

由于语言障碍，人们不得不使用肢体语言来阻断交流。然而，它并不像流利地掌握语言那样有效。坦率地说，人们去外国旅行时可能会遇到一些困难。例如，当他们租公寓或乘坐出租车时，他们需要使用母语申请公寓或电梯。此外，当他们给汽车加油时，他们需要告诉加油站服务员卡车的类型和身份。后者建议人们在去外国旅行之前应该学习母语。
